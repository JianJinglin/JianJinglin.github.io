I finished reading Dario Amodei's very long *Machines of Loving Grace* late last night. Honestly, when I got to the section on biology and drug discovery, I sat up straight in my chair.

## On the "Compressed 21st Century"

Dario proposes a concept that genuinely excites me: AI could compress 50-100 years of progress in human biology into just 5-10 years. He calls it the "compressed 21st century."

As a PhD student doing AI-driven drug discovery at Scripps every day, this concept isn't abstract to me — it's an amplified version of what I already feel in the lab. Our group uses AI for molecular generation, target prediction, and binding affinity modeling. Every time a model produces a good result, you can feel it: yeah, this thing actually works. But Dario is talking about a much bigger picture — not just using AI to analyze data, but having AI become a virtual biologist that can design experiments, run them, and iterate on hypotheses.

He puts it perfectly: **"I am not talking about AI as merely a tool to analyze data."** Too many people think too narrowly about AI's role in biology. AlphaFold already proved that AI can accomplish what decades of physics-based modeling couldn't, but that's just the beginning.

## The Bottlenecks of Drug Discovery

When I got to his analysis of limiting factors, I was nodding furiously. The bottlenecks he describes — the speed limits of the physical world (cell cultures take time, animal experiments take months), data quality issues, intrinsic complexity — these are exactly what I deal with every day.

A huge part of my current work is wrestling with these bottlenecks. Molecular design can be fast, but wet lab validation is always the rate-limiting step. Sometimes a single compound's synthesis route takes weeks, and then the assay takes more weeks on top of that. AI can generate a thousand candidate molecules in seconds, but validating them? That's a whole different story.

But Dario offers an insight I found really illuminating: he argues that what truly drives progress in biology is a small number of key discoveries — CRISPR, mRNA vaccines, CAR-T, and the like. What these discoveries share is that they are **broad measurement tools or techniques** that cut through complexity. And the rate of these discoveries can be accelerated by AI, because they depend more on ingenuity than on brute-force experimentation.

This made me rethink my own research direction. Maybe the most valuable thing isn't optimizing a specific molecule, but inventing new methodologies — new AI-driven experimental paradigms.

## The Anxiety About Inequality

Dario devotes significant space to discussing whether the developing world can share in AI's benefits. This part hit me on an emotional level. I'm from China, doing cutting-edge AI research in the US — I'm very aware of that privilege. If AI really can double human lifespans and eliminate most cancers, but only people in developed countries have access, what kind of victory is that?

He makes a point I strongly agree with: biomedical innovations actually have a decent track record when it comes to deployment. Unlike nuclear power, which was held back for decades by regulation and fear, good drugs tend to be widely adopted once developed. mRNA vaccines are a prime example — the speed from development to global deployment was remarkable.

But I also keep thinking that AI drug discovery itself could help solve this problem. If AI can dramatically reduce the cost of drug development (currently averaging $2.6 billion per new drug from discovery to market), then affordable medicine stops being an empty slogan.

## Some Personal Reflections

What moved me most about the whole essay was actually Dario's tone. As Anthropic's CEO, he's spent so much time talking about AI risks that many people assume he's a doomer. But this essay reveals another side of him — someone who genuinely believes technology can make the world better, but who thinks we need to manage the risks first.

**"Fear is one kind of motivator, but it's not enough: we need hope as well."**

I read that line several times over. Friends who work in AI safety often give me an apocalyptic vibe, but Dario is right — you can't run on fear alone. We need a vision worth fighting for.

As someone working at the intersection of AI and biology, I feel like I'm standing in a very special place. When I'm writing code, tuning models, and reading papers day after day, I sometimes lose sight of the big picture. But after reading this essay, I was reminded: what we're doing could potentially change countless lives.

This isn't hype. It's responsibility.

Alright, time to go read papers. Lab meeting tomorrow. ☀️

# 中文版 / Chinese Version

昨天深夜读完了 Dario Amodei 那篇很长很长的 *Machines of Loving Grace*。说实话，读到生物和药物发现那一段的时候，我整个人都坐直了。

## 关于「压缩的21世纪」

Dario 提出了一个让我很兴奋的概念：AI 可能会把人类生物学未来 50-100 年的进展，压缩到 5-10 年里完成。他称之为 "compressed 21st century"。

作为一个每天在 Scripps 做 AI drug discovery 的 PhD 学生，这个概念对我来说不是抽象的——它就是我每天在实验室里感受到的东西的放大版。我们组里用 AI 做分子生成、做靶点预测、做 binding affinity 的建模，每一次模型跑出一个好的结果，都能感觉到：嗯，这个东西真的在 work。但 Dario 说的是更大的图景——不仅仅是用 AI 分析数据，而是让 AI 成为一个 virtual biologist，能设计实验、跑实验、迭代假说。

这一点他说得特别好：**"I am not talking about AI as merely a tool to analyze data."** 太多人把 AI 在生物领域的角色想窄了。AlphaFold 已经证明了 AI 能做到人类几十年物理建模做不到的事，但那只是开始。

## 药物发现的瓶颈

读到他分析 limiting factors 的时候，我疯狂点头。他说的那几个瓶颈——物理世界的速度限制（细胞培养要时间，动物实验要好几个月）、数据质量问题、内在复杂性——这些就是我每天面对的东西。

我现在做的工作很大一部分就是在跟这些瓶颈搏斗。分子设计可以很快，但 wet lab validation 永远是那个 rate-limiting step。有时候一个 compound 的合成路线就要好几周，然后 assay 又要几周。AI 可以在几秒钟内生成一千个候选分子，但验证它们？那是另一个故事了。

不过 Dario 有一个洞察让我觉得很有启发：他说真正推动生物学进步的是少数几个关键发现——CRISPR、mRNA 疫苗、CAR-T 这些。这些发现的共同点是它们都是 **broad measurement tools or techniques**，能够 cut through complexity。而这些发现的 rate of discovery 是可以被 AI 加速的，因为它们更多地依赖 ingenuity 而不是 brute-force 实验。

这让我重新思考自己的研究方向。也许最有价值的不是优化某个具体的分子，而是发明新的方法论——新的 AI-driven experimental paradigm。

## 关于不平等的焦虑

Dario 花了很大篇幅讨论发展中国家能不能也享受到 AI 带来的好处。这一部分让我有点 emotional。我来自中国，我在美国做 cutting-edge AI research，这种 privilege 我是很清楚的。如果 AI 真的能让人类寿命翻倍、消灭大部分癌症，但这些技术只有发达国家的人能用到，那算什么胜利？

他提到了一个我很认同的观点：生物医学创新在部署方面其实有不错的 track record。不像核能被监管和恐惧拖慢了几十年，好的药物一旦被开发出来，通常会被广泛使用。mRNA 疫苗就是个例子——从开发到全球部署，速度快得惊人。

但我也在想，AI drug discovery 本身可能就能帮助解决这个问题。如果 AI 能大幅降低药物开发的成本（现在一个新药从发现到上市平均要花 26 亿美元），那 affordable medicine 就不再是一个空洞的口号了。

## 一些个人感受

读完整篇文章，最让我感动的其实是 Dario 的 tone。作为 Anthropic 的 CEO，他花了大量时间谈论 AI 风险，以至于很多人以为他是个 doomer。但这篇文章展示了他的另一面——一个真正相信技术可以让世界变好的人，只是他觉得我们必须先把风险管好。

**"Fear is one kind of motivator, but it's not enough: we need hope as well."**

这句话我读了好几遍。做 AI safety 的朋友们经常给我一种世界末日的感觉，但 Dario 说得对——你不能只靠恐惧驱动。我们需要一个值得为之奋斗的愿景。

作为一个在 AI 和生物交叉领域工作的人，我觉得自己站在一个很特别的位置。每天写代码、调模型、读文献的时候，偶尔会忘记 big picture。但读完这篇文章，我又被提醒了：我们做的事情，able 可以改变无数人的生命。

这不是 hype，这是 responsibility。

好了，写到这里该去看 paper 了。Lab meeting 明天见。☀️
