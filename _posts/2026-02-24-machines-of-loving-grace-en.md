I finished reading Dario Amodei's very long *Machines of Loving Grace* late last night. Honestly, when I got to the section on biology and drug discovery, I sat up straight in my chair.

## On the "Compressed 21st Century"

Dario proposes a concept that genuinely excites me: AI could compress 50-100 years of progress in human biology into just 5-10 years. He calls it the "compressed 21st century."

As a PhD student doing AI-driven drug discovery at Scripps every day, this concept isn't abstract to me — it's an amplified version of what I already feel in the lab. Our group uses AI for molecular generation, target prediction, and binding affinity modeling. Every time a model produces a good result, you can feel it: yeah, this thing actually works. But Dario is talking about a much bigger picture — not just using AI to analyze data, but having AI become a virtual biologist that can design experiments, run them, and iterate on hypotheses.

He puts it perfectly: **"I am not talking about AI as merely a tool to analyze data."** Too many people think too narrowly about AI's role in biology. AlphaFold already proved that AI can accomplish what decades of physics-based modeling couldn't, but that's just the beginning.

## The Bottlenecks of Drug Discovery

When I got to his analysis of limiting factors, I was nodding furiously. The bottlenecks he describes — the speed limits of the physical world (cell cultures take time, animal experiments take months), data quality issues, intrinsic complexity — these are exactly what I deal with every day.

A huge part of my current work is wrestling with these bottlenecks. Molecular design can be fast, but wet lab validation is always the rate-limiting step. Sometimes a single compound's synthesis route takes weeks, and then the assay takes more weeks on top of that. AI can generate a thousand candidate molecules in seconds, but validating them? That's a whole different story.

But Dario offers an insight I found really illuminating: he argues that what truly drives progress in biology is a small number of key discoveries — CRISPR, mRNA vaccines, CAR-T, and the like. What these discoveries share is that they are **broad measurement tools or techniques** that cut through complexity. And the rate of these discoveries can be accelerated by AI, because they depend more on ingenuity than on brute-force experimentation.

This made me rethink my own research direction. Maybe the most valuable thing isn't optimizing a specific molecule, but inventing new methodologies — new AI-driven experimental paradigms.

## The Anxiety About Inequality

Dario devotes significant space to discussing whether the developing world can share in AI's benefits. This part hit me on an emotional level. I'm from China, doing cutting-edge AI research in the US — I'm very aware of that privilege. If AI really can double human lifespans and eliminate most cancers, but only people in developed countries have access, what kind of victory is that?

He makes a point I strongly agree with: biomedical innovations actually have a decent track record when it comes to deployment. Unlike nuclear power, which was held back for decades by regulation and fear, good drugs tend to be widely adopted once developed. mRNA vaccines are a prime example — the speed from development to global deployment was remarkable.

But I also keep thinking that AI drug discovery itself could help solve this problem. If AI can dramatically reduce the cost of drug development (currently averaging $2.6 billion per new drug from discovery to market), then affordable medicine stops being an empty slogan.

## Some Personal Reflections

What moved me most about the whole essay was actually Dario's tone. As Anthropic's CEO, he's spent so much time talking about AI risks that many people assume he's a doomer. But this essay reveals another side of him — someone who genuinely believes technology can make the world better, but who thinks we need to manage the risks first.

**"Fear is one kind of motivator, but it's not enough: we need hope as well."**

I read that line several times over. Friends who work in AI safety often give me an apocalyptic vibe, but Dario is right — you can't run on fear alone. We need a vision worth fighting for.

As someone working at the intersection of AI and biology, I feel like I'm standing in a very special place. When I'm writing code, tuning models, and reading papers day after day, I sometimes lose sight of the big picture. But after reading this essay, I was reminded: what we're doing could potentially change countless lives.

This isn't hype. It's responsibility.

Alright, time to go read papers. Lab meeting tomorrow. ☀️
