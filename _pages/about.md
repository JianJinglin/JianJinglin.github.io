Hi there! I'm Jinglin Jian (简靖琳 in Chinese) and I'm in my first year of a Master's program in **Information Sciences** at UIUC. Since the fall of 2023, I had the oppotunity to work with Professor [Haohan Wang](https://haohanwang.github.io/) at UIUC. Previously, I hold a B.S. in Educational Technology from Beijing Normal University, where I contributed as a research assistant in Professor [Jingjing Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TJxt0-0AAAAJ&hl=en)'s lab. Also, I earned a double bachelor's degree in Economics from Peking University.

I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. oppotunity. My academic interests are in **natural language processing**, **intelligent agents**, especially in creating **human-centered AI**.
